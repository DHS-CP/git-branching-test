# git-branching-test
Used as a class test repo for experimenting with branching and permissions

For this assignment, each table group should have one student clone this repository:

  git clone https://github.com/DHS-CP/git-branching-test.git

Next, move into the top level of the code and do the following:

 git status
 
 git branch                           (At this point both git status and git branch will tell you what branch you are on)
 
  git checkout -b FnameLastname       (Use your firstname and Lastname)
  
  vim FnameLastName.txt              (put all elbow partner names into the text file and save)
  
  git add FnameLastName.txt
  
  git commit -m "adding our team's test file for ...."  (include initials) 
  
  git push --set-upstream origin FnameLastname

  Then look at the repo through the github web interface to see if your pull request was sucessful.  You may need me to check,
  or your buildmasters (I will give them admin rights)
